TYPO3 extension to simplify writing cropVariants for TYPO3
Integrators/Developers

> The release of the functionality of my crop variants builder (for
> TYPO3 8.7 & 9.5) into its own extension was supported by supseven.

## Past

The initial public version was part of
`https://github.com/josefglatz/TYPO3-Distribution`. The demands grew in
2019 and therefore I came up with a new idea how to support also the
TYPO3 site configuration which was introduced in TYPO3 9.5 LTS.

## Future

The functionality of this extension will stay as it is. There will be no
direct successor to which you can update and migrate automatically (from
my current perspective). I will link the new extension here when it's
publicly available.

Cheers to all TYPO3 enthusiasts out there!
